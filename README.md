## Purpose of this project

Kendo knowledge are stored in people's minds, books, online videos, blogs, etc. When we face a question, we may struggle to find the answer.

This project is trying to make answer-searching a bit easier.

After we know the answer, the next step is to understand them. One day we may find a better one.
