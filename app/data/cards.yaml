  details: |-
    - Especially the right wrist which is the target for Kote, and right elbow which is close to the right Do
    - Although Do is hard to break, we should tie the Do corectly
    - Make sure the left and right are even
    - Make sure the Do Himo is ok
    - For elbow and wrist, you can find protections in some Kendo supplier
    - Especially for people who got bruise frequently
    - We should find the opportunity to strike the Do, not because we want to but it's not the right time.

- title: Video as different view
  details: |-
    At practice, we can only see things in our subjective view. Video records provide the possibility to save and see ourselves in the same time but in different view.
    We can use videos to check which parts we're doing right and which parts we're doing wrong, what is our strength and what is our weakness. Even we got feedback from different Sensei and different people, if we cannot see what we're doing, we cannot understand. Checking the difference between what is right as we know and what we are doing, then we can understand the comments. Without seeing the difference, the future is behind the fog.
    This is the essential way we can be better, by watching and understanding ourselves. Some people can build the feedback process by self-awareness, and video might be a bit easier. Video recording should help us think and understand how to improve, and it should encourage thinking.
