- title: About Suburi
  details: |-
    - Suburi is the basic of Kendo. Doing Suburi in a right path will get improved faster, otherwise it won't get improved.
    - It's not easy to check if we're doing right just by feeling because our eyes cannot see ourselves directly.
    - Get some feedbacks, like getting advide from Sensei, replaying video taps, using mirror, getting advice from fellows, etc.
    - But getting feedbacks is not enough, we need to know why, why the advice works.
    - At some time, we can feel how mind coodiates with the body, and how leg muscles, torso, arms, bones coordinate with each other, then we can control them for a good strike.

- title: Suburi Body work
  details: |-
    - Push left leg first to initiate a cut
    - Mind focus on footwork more, less on hand work
    - Always use foot power to drive torso movement, and spread the power to hand to Kensen (tip of Shinai) for swing
    - Tense shoulders block the power from torso
    - Feel center of gravity
    - Feel power spreading across the body
    - It takes time to feel how to use body muscles
  tags:
  - Suburi
  - 素振り
- title: Suburi Cut (Strike)
  details: |-
    - Use arm and elbow to swing the shinai, use power from torso
    - Keep elbow close to body line, the elbow should move up and down, not left, not right.
    - When striking, right leg should catch up and the body is back to kamae position, 冴え, for next strike
    - The momentum of 冴え, adds additional power for clean cut.
    - **Relax** a bit of hands and arms after each strike, no hammer strike.
    - The trajectory of Shinai, should follow the blade. If not we will break a real Katana's blade, 刃筋
    - Use Monouchi to hit the target, not too deep, not too shallow.
    - The correct area of Monouchi depends on the size of target, Kote is the smallest, Do is the biggest.
    - Kiai means a spirit of dedication, show to both ourselves and opponents
    - Kiai is also the easy way to synchronize the mind and body
    - Kiai is like incantation of magic. High rank Kenshi with strong Ki like advanced magicians sometimes skip the chanting

- title: Why kendo?
  details: |-
    - In life, a lot of things take days, months, years, then you **MAY** get feedback about if you're doing right or doing wrong.
    - Kendo is in another way, if you're doing wrong then you know it (feedback) immediately. That's a good test field to learn the meta knowledge of improvement.
    - Human society takes millions of years and collects myriads of knowledge that support our modern life
    - If we want to reinvent from scratch that is impossible
    - The best way is to learn from our predecessors.
    - It's not free lunch, we still need understand the logic behind these knowledge and invention, in this way we can know the context and how to use them.
  tags:
  - Why kendo
- title: Why this project
  details: |-
    - It helps me check which I understand which I don't, - It helps me check the knowledge I know how to use and which I don't.
    - This buildup helps me walk on the right paths of improvement, not the paths which repeat same errors.
  tags:
  - Why this project
- title: Purpose of this project
  details: |-
    Kendo knowledge are stored in people's minds, books, online videos, blogs, etc.
    When we face a question, we may struggle to find them.
    This project is trying to make answer searching a bit easier.
    After we know the answer, the next step is to understand them. One day we may find a better answer.
  tags:
  - Why this project
- title: What we're looking for in a video

    - If the foot work is right
    - If the body work is right
    - If the arm moving and Shinai trajectory is right
    - If the cutting angle (Hasuji)
    - Check mindset at the moment and spirit
    - Find **one or two** points that can be improved, especially the easy points
  tags:
  - video recording
- title: Videos provide different angle to see ourselves
  details: |-
    At practice, we can only see things in front.
    Video records provide the way to see ourselves in the same moment but in different view.
    We can use videos to check which parts we're doing right and which parts we're doing wrong
    what is our strength and what is our weakness.
    Even we got feedback from different Sensei and different people, if we cannot see what we're doing, we cannot understand.
