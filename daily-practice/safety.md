# Safety of practice

- We don't want to get injured
- We don't want to injury our fellow practioners
- If people get injured it will take weeks or months to recover

## Shinai

- We should check our Shinai condition before and after practice
- Make sure
    - no cracks
    - no fractures
    - Kensen is tight
    - Nakayui is in right position and tight
    - Tsuru is tight
- Suggest to untie Shinai and check both inside and outside
    - many crasks are hidden inside
- **Never use a broken Shinai**
- **Never use a suspecious Shinai for Tsuki**
- Pay some attention to your opponent's Shinai, if you find it's broken let them know and switch it
- Prepare at least **Two** Shinai, **Three** would be better
- Write a name or any identifier on Tsuka

## Wrist and Elbow

- Especially the right wrist which is the target for Kote, and right elbow which is close to the right Do
- Although Do is hard to break, we should tie the Do corectly
    - Make sure the left and right are even
    - Make sure the Do Himo is ok
- For elbow and wrist, you can find protections in some Kendo supplier
    - Especially for people who got bruise frequently
- We should find the opportunity to strike the Do, not because we want to but it's not the right time.

## Kata and BKKK

- It's hard for new practioners to control their Bokuto, so carefulness needs to be taken
