# Suburi checklist

- Suburi is the basic of the basic of Kendo, wrong Suburi will get invalid point and prevent growth.
- as doing Suburi more and more, I can feel I can use the feeling to check the Suburi, it's called **proprioception**, but using a mirror and video recording is always another good option, the feedback is more accurate and direct. Get help from higher ranked people are also helpful
