# Suburi

Version: 2025-05-06

Suburi is the basic of the basic of Kendo, wrong Suburi will learn to wrong learning path.
This guide is trying to make a list for checking if I'm doing Suburi in a right way. Because it's not easy to check if we're doing right, using feeling (proprioception), and using video recording are all helpful. The key of checking is using some ways to give me feedback.

## Kamae

### Hand and Grip

- left hand should be naturally in front of abdomen, about 1 fist away
- both hand should hold the Shinai over the top
- both hand should hold Shinai tightly using ring, and little finger
- the thumb and index finger should not squeeze the Shinai

### Body posture

- upper body should be straight, not lean forward
- upper body, especially shoulder, should be relax
- body should be facing forward, not to the left, not to the right,
    - facing directly to the opponent

### Feet

- both feet should point forward
- keep left heel up, and be ready to push the body
- check distribution of weight, it should be easy to push the body forward

### Shinai/Bokuto position

- the blade should be facing down
- tip of Shinai (Kensen) should point to opponent's eye or throat

### Watch the opponent

- always watch the whole body of the opponent, not a small area like Men, or Kote, or Doh only.


## Shomen

- Use Shinai or Bokuto to cut, not strike
- Use 刃筋 (Hasuji)
- Always using big cut, left hand one fist away from forehead
- When swing up, kensen should not lower than hand
- Cut using power from body and left foot, while torso, shoulder, elbow and hand should transfer the power to blade tip (Mono-uchi)
- Strong Kiai

## Sayu-men 左右面

- For checking if the cut is in 45 degree, check the 柄頭 (Tsuka-gashira), because it's always parallel to the shape of blade　(刀の上身).
- Left hand should keep in the center
