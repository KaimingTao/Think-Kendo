# Mind training

> The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeing new sights, but in looking with new eyes. (Marcel Proust)

## Why mindset matters a lot?

- The mind determines how we perceive things and how we think.
- The way we think influences the decisions, the choices we make.
- Our decisions shape our actions.
- What we have done and what we will do define ourselves and shape our future.

## What is mind?

- Mind is a powerful simulation tool that help us understand the world around us.

## Self awareness

- self awareness is about
    - knowing what I'm thinking
    - knowing what I'm doing
    - knowing the consequence of my actions

## Be a good communicator

- When we don't know if we're doing right or wrong, we need ask
- Before ask we ask, think about our question, find our answers
    - communicate after thinking is more efficient and can learn more
- When we are taught by Sensei, reply if we hear it or understand it
    - a communication with the Sensei makes them know if they are communicating efficiently
    - if we don't reply anything, **no one** knows if we understand or not

## Loop of mind

- the mind as a feedback system has internal loop

## The simple cycle of improvement

- be honest to ourselves
- watch ourself, how we do and how we think
- know our good habit and bad habit
- try to find a way to correct bad habit
- try to improve good habit

## Focus & Relax

- Focus on the training and practice.
- Don't add pressure to ourselves, normally the pressure is not from opponent, but the refletion of our fearness.
