# Mindset

## Why mindset matters a lot?

- The mind determines how we perceive things and how we think.
- The way we think influences the decisions, the choices we make.
- Our decisions shape our actions.
- What we have done and what we will do define ourselves and shape our future.

## Self awareness

- self awareness is about
    - knowing what I'm thinking
    - knowing what I'm doing
    - knowing the consequence of my actions


## Be a good communicator

- When we don't know if we're doing right or wrong, we need ask
- Before ask we ask, think about our question, find our answers
    - communicate after thinking is more efficient and can learn more
- When we are taught by Sensei, reply if we hear it or understand it
    - a communication with the Sensei makes them know if they are communicating efficiently
    - if we don't reply anything, **no one** knows if we understand or not
