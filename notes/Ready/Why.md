## Why kendo?

- In life, a lot of things take days, months, years, then you **MAY** get feedback about if you're doing right or doing wrong.
- Kendo is in another way, if you're doing wrong then you know it (feedback) immediately. That's a good test field to learn the meta knowledge of improvement.
- Human society takes millions of years and collects myriads of knowledge that support our modern life
- If we want to reinvent from scratch that is impossible
- The best way is to learn from our predecessors.
- It's not free lunch, we still need understand the logic behind these knowledge and invention, in this way we can know the context and how to use them.
