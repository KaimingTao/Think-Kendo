## Safety of practice

- We don't want to get injured
- We don't want to injury our fellow practioners
- If people got injured it will take weeks or months to recover, and back to practice

## Check Shinai

- We should check our Shinai condition *before*, *after*, and *in* practice
- No cracks
- No fractures
- String (弦 つる) is tight
- 中結 is tight, and in correct position
- Kensen (剣先), tip of shinai is intact
- **Never** use a broken Shinai
- **Never** use a suspecious Shinai for Tsuki
- Pay some attention to your opponent's Shinai, if you find it's broken let them know and switch it

## Maintain Shinai

- Suggest to fully untie Shinai and check both inside and outside, many crasks are hidden inside
- Prepare at least **Two** Shinai, **Three** would be better
- Write your name or any identifier on Tsuka

## Protect Wrist and Elbow

- Especially the right wrist which is the target for Kote, and right elbow which is close to the right Do

- Tie the Do corectly to protect our torso
- Make sure the left side and right side are at the same height
- Make sure the Do Himo can firmly hold the Do

- For elbow and wrist, you can find protectors frm some Kendo supplier
- It's for people who got bruise frequently

- We should find the opportunity to strike the Do, not because we want to which will injure your friends.

## Kata and BKKK Safety

- It's hard for new practioners to control their Bokuto, so be careful of how they swing
- Keep enough distance between praction pairs, make sure they won't interfere and injury people nearby.

- Prevent concussion
