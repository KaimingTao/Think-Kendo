## About Suburi

- Suburi is the basic of Kendo. Doing Suburi in a right path will get improved faster, otherwise it won't get improved.
- It's not easy to check if we're doing right just by feeling because our eyes cannot see ourselves directly.
- Get some feedbacks, like getting advide from Sensei, replaying video taps, using mirror, getting advice from fellows, etc.
- But getting feedbacks is not enough, we need to know why, why the advice works.
- At some time, we can feel how mind coodiates with the body, and how leg muscles, torso, arms, bones coordinate with each other, then we can control them for a good strike.

## Kamae Shinai/Bokuto position

## Suburi Body work

- Push left leg first to initiate a cut
- Mind focus on footwork more, less on hand work
- Always use foot power to drive torso movement, and spread the power to hand to Kensen (tip of Shinai) for swing
- Tense shoulders block the power from torso
- Feel center of gravity
- Feel power spreading across the body
- It takes time to feel how to use body muscles

## Suburi Cut (Strike)

- Use arm and elbow to swing the shinai, use power from torso
- Keep elbow close to body line, the elbow should move up and down, not left, not right.
- When striking, right leg should catch up and the body is back to kamae position, 冴え, for next strike
- The momentum of 冴え, adds additional power for clean cut.
- **Relax** a bit of hands and arms after each strike, no hammer strike.
- The trajectory of Shinai, should follow the blade. If not we will break a real Katana's blade, 刃筋
- Use Monouchi to hit the target, not too deep, not too shallow.
- The correct area of Monouchi depends on the size of target, Kote is the smallest, Do is the biggest.
- Kiai means a spirit of dedication, show to both ourselves and opponents
- Kiai is also the easy way to synchronize the mind and body
- Kiai is like incantation of magic. High rank Kenshi with strong Ki like advanced magicians sometimes skip the chanting
