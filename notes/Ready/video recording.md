## What we're looking for in a video

- If the foot work is right
- If the body work is right
- If the arm moving and Shinai trajectory is right
- If the cutting angle (Hasuji)
- Check mindset at the moment and spirit
- Find **one or two** points that can be improved, especially the easy points

## Videos provide different angle to see ourselves

At practice, we can only see things in front.

Video records provide the way to see ourselves in the same moment but in different view.

We can use videos to check which parts we're doing right and which parts we're doing wrong
what is our strength and what is our weakness.

Even we got feedback from different Sensei and different people, if we cannot see what we're doing, we cannot understand.
Checking the difference between what is right as we know and what we are doing, then we can understand the comments.

Without understanding, the improvement is impossible.

## The essential way we can be better, is by watching and understanding ourselves.

Some people can build the feedback process by **self-awareness**, and also use help from video or feedback.

Video recording should help us think and understand how to improve, and it should encourage thinking.

## Understand what we have recorded.

Recording the video is a way to check what we know, without correct knowledge, it's hard to interpret what just happened.

## Recording Kamae

- Where is the kensen pointing
- Are both the feet facing forward
- How the foot push forward

tags: video recording, Kamae

## Recording Suburi

- See left hand's position when swing the Shinai and when cutting
- See if hands move first or body moves first?
- Sae **冴え**, does left foot catch up when cutting?
- Tenouchi or hammer-strike
- Where is center of gravity
- Shoulder tense

## There are many people in this video. How to know where am I?

- If you cannot tell where you're, maybe have your name on Kendo-Gi or Hakama.
- Advanced people can easily identify themselves, because I guess they watched themselves many times

## I have the video but it didn't catch the key part

- Try recording next time
- We cannot expect one video can catch everything
- Sometimes it's just because we were faraway from the camera in practice

## I forgot recording today, what should I do?

- It's ok, the good and bad habits repeat themselves, we can catch it next time.

## Where to store the video?

Video files are normally big and are about 1 ~ 2 hours.

Several factors help us to decide which method to choose:

- Cost
- Easy access video
- Privacy
- Sharing

## Store videos on Cloud storage

- Normally has big storage
- Need download then access the data
- Need pay monthly or annual fee
- Easy to share with others

## Store videos on Youtube

- Unlimited storage space
- Can access videos anywhere, but need internet access
- Need take time to upload the video
- Need set video as `unlisted` to share with other people, the data are still exposed to anyone
- It has privacy issue.
- I suggest to hide very old videos.
- the company may use your video to train their AI
