# Video as different view


At practice, we can only see things in our subjective view. Video records provide the possibility to save and see ourselves in the same time but in different view.

We can use videos to check which parts we're doing right and which parts we're doing wrong, what is our strength and what is our weakness. Even we got feedback from different Sensei and different people, if we cannot see what we're doing, we cannot understand. Checking the difference between what is right as we know and what we are doing, then we can understand the comments. Without seeing the difference, the future is behind the fog.

This is the essential way we can be better, by watching and understanding ourselves. Some people can build the feedback process by self-awareness, and video might be a bit easier. Video recording should help us think and understand how to improve, and it should encourage thinking.

## What we're recording?

Recording the video is a way to check what we know, without correct knowledge, it's hard to interpret what just happened.

Here is an example list of things that's easy to be recognized

- Kamae
	- where is the kensen pointing
	- are both the feet facing forward
- Suburi
	- Left hand position when cutting and when swing the Shinai
	- Sae 冴え, does left foot catch up when cutting?
	- Tenouchi or hammer-strike
	- Body motion, where is center of gravity
- Shoulder tense
- more and more things .....

## Common issues

- How to know where am I? There are many people in this video
	- If you cannot tell where you're, maybe have your name on Kendo-Gi or Hakama.
	- Advanced people can easily identify themselves, because I guess they watched themselves many times
- I have the video but it didn't catch the key part
	- Try next time, we cannot expect one video can catch everything, sometimes it's just we were faraway from the camera in practice
- I forgot recording today, what should I do?
	- It's ok, if some situations repeatedly show, we can catch it next time.

## Where to store the video

Video files are normally big and record 1 ~ 2 hours. Several factors affect which method to choose:

- storage space
- cost
- easy access video
- privacy
- share with others

Here is the pros and cons of different method

- personal computer or cell phone
	- we can easily access the file
	- has limited storage
	- if the device is broken, the video could be broken too
	- hard to share with other people
- Portable HDD or SSD
	- we can easily access the file
	- normally has bigger storage
	- if the device is broken, we cannot access the data
	- a bit hard to share with many people
- Cloud storage
	- normally has big storage
	- need download then access the data
	- need pay monthly or annual fee
	- easy to share with others
	- need internet access
- Youtube
	- unlimited storage space
	- can access anywhere, but need internet access
	- need take time to upload the video
	- need set video as `unlisted` to share with other people, the data are still exposed to anyone, it has privacy issue. Suggest to hide very old videos.
